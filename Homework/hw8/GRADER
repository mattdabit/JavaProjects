Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  
  Why or why not?

  My mergesort is stable because it sorts the list starting with the beginning elements. If a number equals a previous number it will be placed after because I use enqueue

  Is quicksort stable?  
  Why or why not?

  Quicksort is not stable because it works off pivot points. It does not matter if  the number is in the list it will be put into the equal queue. The numbers will be mixed depending on its orientaion to the pivot point.
