If another application were to create one of our DLists and use the DListNode 
class we can run into problems. If the user wants to create DListNode and use
it in some of methods of DList and the DListNode is not part of this.DList 
then we run into issues. The DListNode in our current parameters issume that 
the Dlist contains the specific DlistNode. For example if I create a Dlistnode 
object and pass it through as a parameter in the remove method.
